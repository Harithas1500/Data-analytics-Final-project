Data analytics final project: Full Insights Summary
1. Data Understanding and Cleaning

The dataset was first explored to check its structure, missing values, and inconsistencies.

Duplicate entries and irrelevant columns were removed to ensure accurate analysis.

Date and numeric columns were formatted properly, and categorical values were standardized.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We examined each variable individually (univariate analysis) to understand distribution and key statistics.

Relationships between two variables (bivariate) and multiple variables (multivariate) were explored using groupby, pivot tables, and correlation analysis.

Outliers and unusual patterns were detected, helping identify areas that need attention.

3. Visualizations

Various charts were created to visualize the data clearly:

Bar charts & stacked bars – compare categories and sub-categories.

Line charts – show trends over time.

Pie & donut charts – display proportions of categories.

Histograms & violin plots – show distribution of sales and profit.

Scatter & bubble charts – explore relationships between metrics.

Heatmaps & pair plots – check correlations and patterns.

All charts included clear titles, labels, and legends for easy understanding.

4. Key Findings

A few categories and sub-categories dominate total sales, while others contribute less.

High sales do not always mean high profit; some categories generate low or negative profit despite good sales.

Monthly trends showed peaks in certain periods, suggesting possible seasonal effects.

Correlation analysis indicated a strong positive link between sales and profit, but other factors showed weak relationships.

Outliers in sales and profit highlight unusual transactions that could affect overall analysis.

5. Recommendations

Focus on high-profit categories instead of only high sales to improve overall business performance.

Investigate loss-making sub-categories to understand the reasons behind low profit.

Plan inventory and marketing campaigns according to observed seasonal trends.

Use segmentation (like location or customer type) for more targeted strategies in future analysis.
