Data analytics final project: Full Insights Summary
Project Overview

The main goals of this project were to:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on raw e-commerce data to ensure accuracy.

Explore product features such as retail price, discounted price, discount percentage, and ratings.

Visualize the data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Identify trends in product categories, pricing patterns, and brand distribution.

Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.

Corrected formats for numeric and date columns.

Handled missing or inconsistent data for accurate analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed individual variables (univariate) to see distributions.

Checked relationships between two or more variables (bivariate/multivariate) using groupby, pivot tables, and correlations.

Detected outliers and unusual patterns in sales, price, and ratings.

3. Visualizations

Created bar charts, line charts, pie/donut charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bubble charts, heatmaps, and pair plots.

All visuals had clear titles, labels, and legends to make interpretation easy.

Subplots were used where necessary to compare multiple visuals together.

4. Key Findings

Certain categories and brands dominate sales and revenue.

High sales do not always correspond to high profit or high ratings.

Pricing patterns and discounts vary across categories and brands.

Seasonal trends and peaks were observed in sales and product demand.

5. Recommendations

Focus on high-profit categories and popular brands.

Investigate low-performing or low-rated products to improve sales.

Plan promotions and inventory based on observed seasonal trends.

Use insights to optimize pricing and discount strategies for better profitability
